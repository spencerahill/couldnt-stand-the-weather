# Time to get ready for the storm

June 9th, 2024

*Executive Summary: This blog will discuss music, climate, weather, climate and weather in music, and climate and weather in other media (mediums?).*

## Intro

I am a climate scientist that specializes in tropical atmospheric dynamics, especially monsoons.  I am also pretty obsessed with music.  And I am interested in the connections among science, music, and other artistic media (mediums?).

Because being a scientist is my job, I already spend a lot of time each week thinking about science for its own sake. I get to think about music etc. much less. So this blog is an attempt to scratch the itch I have to think and share more about music.  The connections made with climate and weather will, I hope, make it unique.

I have been doing something similar on Twitter for a while now via my [#CliSciHiFi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CliSciHiFi) series of tweets. Those have been a blast (despite not exactly having gone viral), but sometimes there is simply more to say than can fit in a tweet.

## The title

[Couldn’t Stand The Weather](https://www.amazon.com/Couldnt-Weather-Legacy-Vaughan-Trouble/dp/B003MX5OOY/) is an album by Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, their second, released in 1984. “Couldn’t Stand The Weather” is also the second track thereof---after the opener `[“Scuttle Buttin’”](https://youtu.be/IUsvRaRk9Fs), a personal SRV favorite.  It captures a couple things I’m trying to accomplish here.  First, obviously, is linking weather/climate and music. Second, less obviously, is fun. The song is funky, driving, a tune you can’t help but nod your head to.  It’s also bluesy, with a hell of a lot of soul.  I hope this blog ends up the same way: fun but with substance.

If you’re really feeling the SRV vibes, check out the song’s official [music video](https://youtu.be/nO23B5C_Mcw).  It’s good on a surface level for some laughs at the 1980s production cheese (see screenshot on the right). On a deeper level, sure the symbolic montage of people yelling at each other is heavy-handed---though in 2024, maybe it's right on the money---but it actually also connects with another of my aims: tuning out the shouting matches to just groove.  A lot of climate science media coverage and in the blogosphere is much closer to the shouting folks in the video than any of us would probably care to admit.  Here, we’re trying to be Stevie and the fellas jamming instead.

In other words, I couldn't stand the weather, and this is the result.

Anyways, SRV is rightly known for his virtuosity as a blues guitarist, but I think he is underrated (especially on the coasts) as a songwriter and lyricist.  Just check out the [lyrics](https://genius.com/Stevie-ray-vaughan-couldnt-stand-the-weather-lyrics) to this track; the second verse especially is as close to Bob Dylan as SRV’s guitar licks are to Jimi Hendrix (which is to say, very close):

```{epigraph}
Runnin’ through this business of life<br>
Raisin’ sand if I’m needed to<br>
Ain’t so funny when things ain’t feelin’ right<br>
Then daddy’s hand helps to see me through<br>
Sweet as sugar, love won’t wash away<br>
Rain or shine, it’s always here to stay<br>
All these years you and I’ve spent together<br>
All this we just, couldn’t stand the weather<br>

Like a train that stops at every station<br>
We all deal with trials and tribulations<br>
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years<br>
Entangled in yellow and cries all his tears<br>
Changes come before we can grow<br>
Learn to see them before we’re too old<br>
Don’t just take me for tryin’ to be heavy<br>
Understand, it’s time to get ready for the storm
```

Couldn’t have said it better myself.
